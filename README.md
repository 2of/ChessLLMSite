# ChessLLM 



ChessLLM is a custom react front end to enable playing against LLM models.


It's fun because LLM's play whacky moves that make no sense.

Wraps Chess.js to allow illegal moves.

Creates a conversation with LLM's using your own API key (define in keys.json at root) and uses some regex to derive moves.


Relatively trivial all things considered.

Note: Gemini pro free tier is too low to complete most games
